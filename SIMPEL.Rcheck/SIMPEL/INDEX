getClusterAndPlots      Function to do statistical analyses and create
                        plots from non-stationary labeling experiments
get_comp_mass           This function is calculating the m/z for the
                        chemical formulae provided
get_comp_mz_lookup      This function is going to evaluate all of the
                        XCMS_data to identify isotopologues
get_comp_stage          This function is going to evaluate all of the
                        XCMS_data to identify isotopologues
get_element_count       This function is calculating the number of each
                        of the elements present in the formula
get_table_objects       Function to process XCMS data for isotopic
                        enrichment and create MID and average labeling
                        objects from non-stationary isotopic labeling
                        experiments
label_enrichment_plot   Function to plot time-course label enrichment
                        both as average_labeling and
                        mole_equivalents_labeling in a non-stationary
                        isotopic labeling experiment XCMS data and
                        start getting isotopic information from the
                        annotation file and add information columns to
                        be used as input for next steps

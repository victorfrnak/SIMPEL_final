\title{Function to plot time-course label enrichment both as average_labeling and mole_equivalents_labeling
in a non-stationary isotopic labeling experiment
XCMS data and start getting isotopic information from the annotation file
and add information columns to be used as input for next steps}
\usage{
label_enrichment_plot(
  mydata,
  Category,
  yLim = NULL,
  xLim = NULL,
  axisTitle1 = "Labeling",
  plotTitle = Bin,
  plotTitle2 = NULL

  mydata,
  Category,
  yLim = NULL,

  axisTitle1 = "Labeling",
  plotTitle = Bin,
  plotTitle2 = NULL
)
}
\arguments{
\item{mydata}{you can use average_labeling or mole_equivalents_labeling as an input for this function}

\item{Category}{will be the tissue type, i.e. WT/Mut, or treatment, i.e treated vs untreated}

\item{plotTitle}{This will be name for the Y-Axis typically it is "\% label  enrichment" for average_labeling and "mole_equivalents" for mole_equivalents_labeling)}

\item{plotTitle2}{This will be name for the Y-Axis typically it is "\% label  enrichment" for average_labeling and "mole_equivalents" for mole_equivalents_labeling)}

\item{ylim}{is the limit of y-axis}

\item{xlim}{is the limit of the x-axis}

\item{axisTitle}{This will be name for the Y-Axis typically it is "\% label  enrichment" for average_labeling and "mole_equivalents" for mole_equivalents_labeling)}
